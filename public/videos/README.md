# How to Update the Carousel Video

## Current Status:
You are currently using **`carousel-bg.MP4`**.
(Note: This file currently appears to be a copy of your welcome video).

## To Change the Background:

1. **Find a NEW video file** that you want to use.
2. **Rename** that new video file to `carousel-bg.MP4`.
3. **Copy and Paste** it into:
   ```
   c:\Users\alami\OneDrive\Desktop\LASTUEH\USMEventHubs\public\videos\
   ```
4. **Overwrite** the existing file when asked.

## Why it looks the same:
Since `carousel-bg.MP4` and `welcome-bg.MP4` contain the **exact same video footage**, switching between them won't change how it looks on screen. You must replace the **file content** with a new video to see a difference.
